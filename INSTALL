You can compile hping3p at least under:

Linux
OpenBSD
FreeBSD
NetBSD
Solaris

But hping3 is beta, for now it was mostly tested only in Linux,
this should change soon now that the first beta is out.

Note that starting from hping3 libpcap should be used
with all the kind of systems, including Linux.

Linux
-----

You need the following libraries to be installed:
libpcap-dev, tcl, tcl-dev

Under Debian, you can install them with:
$ sudo apt install libpcap-dev tcl tcl-dev

Then, please, follow these steps:

$ sudo mkdir --parent /usr/local/man/man8
$ ./configure (first try ./configure --help)
$ vi Makefile (optional)
$ make
$ sudo make install

You can also use:
$ sudo make forced-install

If you want to execute "sudo make install" more than one time, without 
getting an error like the following one:
"ln: failed to create symbolic link '/usr/sbin/hping': File exists"

This additional option has been added in hping3p and was not present
in the original hping3 tool.


FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD
------------------------

You will need the libpcap and the gmake utility installed on your system. 

$ ./configure
$ gmake
$ su (or calife)
# gmake install

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NOTE: You should take care about your net/bpf.h file installing on
      BSD systems (specially with OpenBSD). If your original bpf.h was
      overwritten with the libpcap one probably hping will not work
      with over some interface.

      For example if you use the libpcap bpf.h on OpenBSD hping will
      not work over PPP interfaces.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solaris
-------

$ export CC="gcc"
$ ./configure
$ gmake
$ su
# gmake install

UNINSTALLING hping3p (tested on Ubuntu)
---------------------------------------
Run the clean_install.sh script as root

$ sudo ./clean_install.sh

To setuid hping3 is like to open the port to script kiddies
for now. Don't do it in any real multiuser and otherwise
security-sensitive system.
